# Water_meter_computer_vision
Tasks that can be automated must be automated. But ordinary tasks developed by human beings prove to be complex to be done by machines. 
Digit reading in images is one of them.
The task of reading digits in an image is easily performed by humans, but when trying to implement this ability on machines, difficulties arise. 
Light conditions, image angle, noise, definition, etc. There are many variables that can affect the performance of the system.
This small project analyzes the application of computer vision techniques to the reading of water consumption meters.
