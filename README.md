# Applied computer vision: reading water consumption meters
* This small project analyzes the application of computer vision techniques to the reading of water consumption meters.
* Nowadays many companies accept that electricity and water consumption readings be sent through a photo of the meters. That way the company is easily faced with thousands of images that need to be processed.
* This small project aims to analyze techniques that would make it possible to automate this process.
* Note: this study was done a while ago. Some things could be done differently. We are always learning and improving. It remains as a record of my evolution process.. :-)
